<p>Hi there,
my name is Aline,
I'm a quantitative ecologist and data scientist (and programmer!). I've been working with various biological datasets over the years and I've used all kinds of tools to collect, analyze, and communicate data. I'm always learning new stuff and thinking about how to improve our understanding of things with combinations of new methods.

I started this blog to tell a little bit about very useful tools, methods, tests, and resources that I've encountered over the years and how they helped me. I think that most traditional undergrad and graduate statistics courses only tell ecologists about a few "classic" ways of analyzing data. Most modern research questions, however, require a wider set of methods and skills.
