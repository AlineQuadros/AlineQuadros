While humans might need to perfect their body language to feel more powerful and confident, many animals are also experts on the _Fake it til you make it_ strategy to avoid being eated.
How does it work? Predators capture and kill their preys, but  won't feed on dead creatures (vultures or  scavengers would do that). Taking advantage of that, many animals developed, throughout evolution,  This strategy is known as *apparent dead*, *death-feighning*  or *tonic immobility*.


Woodlice are interesting little creatures. Because they lack major defense structures (like claws or spines) and seem to be quite yummy, virtually all terrestrial animals like to feed. An I mean it. All of them. The known list of predators includes birds, frogs, lizards, small mammals, spiders, and terrestrial flatworms.

**Tonic immobility in terrestrial isopods: intraspecific and interspecific
variability**

*Many arthropods, including terrestrial isopods, are capable of entering a state of tonic immobility upon a
mechanical disturbance. Here we compare the responses to mechanical stimulation in three terrestrial isopods
Balloniscus glaber, B. sellowii and Porcellio dilatatus. We applied three stimuli in a random order and recorded
whether each individual was responsive (i.e. showed tonic immobility) or not and the duration of the response.
In another trial we related the time needed to elicit tonic immobility and the duration of response of
each individual. Balloniscus sellowii was the least responsive species and P. dilatatus was the most, with 23%
and 89% of the tested individuals, respectively, being responsive. Smaller B. sellowii were more responsive
than larger individuals. Porcellio dilatatus responded more promptly than the Balloniscus spp. but it showed
the shortest response. Neither sex, size nor the type of stimulus explained the variability found in the duration
of tonic immobility. These results reveal a large variability in tonic immobility behavior, even between closely
related species, which seems to reflect a species-specific response to predators with different foraging modes.*
