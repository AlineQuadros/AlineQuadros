So, for water quality for instance, it might not be enough just to know that the concentration of nitrates is decreasing, or that the dissolved oxygen is increasing. The gist is to actually know how these features are changing together.
Back in 2018 I was faced with this small challenge, how can we ***visualize*** how a system is changing over time?

Hong Kong Government keeps a well organized, ***open-access*** page with tons of information about the quality of their waters, and how they , which they obtain once a month.
